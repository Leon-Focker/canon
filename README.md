# canon . . . (for solo viola)
This consists of a Lisp script (canon.lsp), using [Slippery Chicken](https://michael-edwards.org/sc/) and brute force to generate a canon. The chords that emerge from the three voices of the canon can all be played either normally or as a harmonic on the viola. In the case of the letter, each of the three notes (root, played and sounding) are viewed as an equal part of the chord.

The second part is the notation (Kanon_fuer_Bratsche.mscx) which contains a lot of information in the main score and can then be split into the actual score and the individual voices.

Kanon_fuer_Bratsche.pdf the actual score and Kanon_fuer_Bratsche_Einzelstimmen.pdf shows how the chords are split into the three canon voices.
